# Python Projects

## About
Learning many various topics and using Python to implement them

The purpose of this projects is to get used to python language from basic operations to object-oriented programming,
web development and machine learning & deep learning

## Projects
### Getting Started with Python
Project containg exercises about basic operations, booleans, conditionals, loops, lists, strings, dictionaries and
working with external libraries

### Machine Learning
Learning machine learning with Kaggle's resources. The purpose was to predict house prices in Iowa.
Contains knowledge about loading data, split it to train and validating datasets and what to do if data has empty values somewhere.
In this course I used basic models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting from scikit-learn library.
Further I learnt about pipelines and used them in basic configuration (Imputer, RandomForestRegressor) and about categorical data.
Using one-hot-encoding or dropping columns methods were measured in mean average error. 
Other measuring metric used in this project was cross-validating score. 

### Taxi Trip
Project made from scratch using knowledge from Machine Learning course. This is a competition from Kaggle's site about predicting 
taxi trip duration in New York City. I was using pipeline with Imputer and Gradient Boosting Regressor. MAE ~ 6 minutes

### Deep Learning
Learning deep learning with Kaggle's resources. Focus mostly on picture recognition and convolutions.
Classifying dogs from picture to their breed.
